        <p [@slideInFromRight]="" >Putting together projects with microcontrollers is kind of like piecing together a puzzle that comes to life. Here's a look at the PCB I'm working on for a programmable wall vaultâ€”it's got a bit of a clock vibe. I'll share more details and the designs once I've finished. </p>
